1. Introduction

	Redirecting FileSystem or RedirFS project aims to be general, fast,
	flexible and open source framework allowing to redirect native 
	filesystem calls in the VFS layer. It is implemented as a 
	LKM(Linux Kernel Module) and provides well defined interface for other
	LKMs which are called Filters. Filters can set pre and post call-back 
	functions for selected filesystem operations(e.g. permission, open). 
	Filters can also select for which file system paths will be their
	call-back functions called and even which file system paths will be
	excluded. Each Filter is specified by a name and unique number which
	represents Filter's priority. RedirFS manages all registered Filters and
	calls their call-back functions in specific order defined by their
	priorities.
